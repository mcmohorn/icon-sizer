# Icon Sizer
Resize a square png into common App Icon sizes.  Download icons individually, or all in a single zip file.  The user selects a square png file and then the user can download that image resized to 180, 120, 90, 87, 80, 60, 58, 40, and 20px-wide square images.  

This is useful when you want to resize a large square image to the various app icon sizes required for iOS development.

# Instructions
Run `npm install && npm start` to install dependencies and start the app.
